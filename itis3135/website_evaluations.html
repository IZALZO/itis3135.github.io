        <h2 style="text-align:center">An Evalustion of Two Websites</h2>
        <h3>This webpage is meant to scrutinize two websites based off of the C.R.A.P. principles.</h3>
        <h3>Link to <a href="https://arngren.net/"> ARNGREN.net</a> a Norwegian site that deals with the sale of many items.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This website adhears to contrast, although barely, most text is readable interms of color</li>
          <li>This website does not adhear to repetiton as all elements are thrown across the screen in different sizes, the only form of repetition it utilizes is repeditally confusing its users.</li>
          <li>This website does not adhear to alignment as again every element is spread wildly across all of its listings using no semblence of a grid.</li>
          <li>This website does not adhear to proximity as as quite litterally every image is overlapping and some even cross the threshold of the main title. </li>
        </ul> 
        
        <h3>Link to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"> Amazon.com</a> a general retail site.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This website adhears to contrast, all text is easily visible and readable even when backgrounds change.</li>
          <li>This website adhears to repetiton, all navigation and heading are the same through all pages and every screen is similar in construct.</li>
          <li>This website adhears to alignment, all listings and pictures are nicely aligned and use well spaced borders to form a concise grid.</li>
          <li>This website adhears to proximity, all photos are well spaced though the navigation bar and header are a bit busy. </li>
        </ul>
